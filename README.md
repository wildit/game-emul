# Game Archiving Showcase

This is a showcase to demonstrate a minimal set of descriptive and technical metadata to archive a piece of software. The RDF file contains the metadata in RiC and PREMIS format to describe the content, context (provenance) and technical environment needed to assess and run a simple computer game. This is done with the RiC and PREMIS metadata standards. The goal is to store enough information in the preservation system to be able to configure and run an emulator. The challenge, on the other hand, is that emulators do change over time, thus the metadata must be generic enough to be used with different emulators on different platforms.

The example was developed for the iPres2022 conference with the goal of keeping computer games from an archived CD-ROM playable.

Based on the metadata, the next step is to show how an emulator can be configured and started in an automated way.
